# 24pill-code
This is a blogging platform, combining my interest and admiration of the effect that `Quora` and `Stackoverflow` has on developers. So I am trying to merge them or something like that or even far fetch from either, worse together. This project is purely written Php.

# Disclaimer
Well, I am a human being and some statement may be read by other human beings and others would like to sue me. `I do not own any of the Brand names or registered names used here` or have anything doing with them directly or implied. I am only using those techs to make my work here, easier.`I do not also claim, should i just add, that I am related to these tech` or any tech that'd be mention or used with mentioning it.

# Techs
1. Php 7
1. Git
1. Bootstrap 4
1. Font-awesome-4.7.0
1. Tinymce
1. Jquery-3.4.1
1. PhpMailer
1. Gmail server (used once to test phpmailer)

# Coding standards
For now I am not glued to any standard as there is.
1. I am trying to imitate MVC pattern or at least I am convinced of it due to the file structure.
1. I mostly use snake case, `eg: var_name`, for everything, from variable naming to file naming.
1. My file naming appear consistent in the `controllers` directory where painfully, all file must end with processor. `eg: hello_world_processor.php`.
1. Anything that can or could be a function is made a function after implementation.

# File structure
1. controllers 
1. includes
1. statics (js, css, img)
1. templates
1. vendor (phpmailer)
1. anything else is a view or `LICENSE`, `README`, `.gitignore`, `24pill_code_db.sql`, `CODING_STANDARDS`, `TODO`, etc.

There is more files. `TODO` is my issue tracker file, any error I am not working on that pops up is reported there.

# Testing
There is no testing yet, those i intend to use PhpUnitTest and Qunit. Well, I do test certain parts that needs trial before implementation.

# Todo - after this
This is a Php version of this project, with a framework (I don't really like the idea of a framework even with its merits). I intend to use a Php framework perhaps Laravel or CodeIgniter or Symphony. I am not sure because I am not into frameworks, if they are not seen as extensions. I will write the same (or similar) project using:
1. Python, considerably `flask`.
1. JavaScript, `nodejs` and a front-end framework like `vue.js` but not sure yet.

# Things I did quietly
In offline mode I use the actual files in the tech stated above but when i am pushing, I'd wanted to comment them out and use the available CDNs.
