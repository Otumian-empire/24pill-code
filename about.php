                <p>I am Otu Michael, in my early twenties, I nearly attended two universities, one for Bsc. IT and the other Bsc. Mathematics/Comp.Sci . I love to assist others to gain new skills and i times teach -I taught in a Junior High School. I started programming in my second year in Senior High School where i dubbled with Python, Html, Css, Javascript, Php, C and Cplusplus, Java and Kotlin for android, up to, almost  a years, perior to creating this blog, i change my focus and delved into web development. I got better day in day out as I either read code, though I get overwhelmed due to the information load and sometimes lack of exposure. Oh, I thought i was the only programmer in the world until i met Kevin and Joeseph.</p>
